## About me
Hi, this is Yu-Sheng Lin from Taiwan, and welcome to my personal page.
I am a VLSI hardware architecturer/engineer, and my professional skill is about parallel processors like GPGPUs.
I am also familiar with several software technieques or languages like CUDA, modern C++ and Python.

## Projects

* [UMI](https://github.com/johnjohnlin/UMI/) (GPL)
	* Write memory-optimized CUDA code easily.
	* Also refer to the paper listed below.
* [MIMORI](https://github.com/johnjohnlin/MIMORI/) (GPL)
	* A memory-efficient and easy-to-use hardware architecture for deep learning and general scientific computations.
	* Papre under reviewing.
* [Nicotb](https://github.com/johnjohnlin/nicotb/) (GPL)
	* Simulate RTL code with Python easily.
	* [Documents](https://johnjohnlin.github.io/nicotb/)
